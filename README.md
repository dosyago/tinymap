# tinymap

A world map in a single SVG, with latitude and longitude

# status

This is a concept. Inspired by [this comment](https://news.ycombinator.com/threads?id=keepamovin)

# tasks

- [ ] borders SVG points
- [ ] conversion between geodetic coordinates and SVG coordinates
- [ ] place names layer
- [ ] GPS locator

# aims

- We should be able to fit the border data in O(20MB) of SVG path.
- There's probably ways we can compress this.
- PWA that can be used to self-locate the person just using a mobile device with GPS.
